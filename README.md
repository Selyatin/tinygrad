# tinygrad
Evaluate flow graphs and compute their gradients. Many methods can be implemented as a flow graph, which include the following examples:
- Neural networks
- Linear classifiers
- Dimensionality reduction

## Install Eigen and compile the example code
- Install Eigen system-wide (Arch Linux: "pacman -S eigen" or manually following the instructions at Eigen website)
- cd /to/tinygrad/repository/folder
- chmod +x build.sh
- ./build.sh
